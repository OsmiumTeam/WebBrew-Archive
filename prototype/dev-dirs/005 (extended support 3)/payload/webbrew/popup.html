    <h4>[<span style="color: red;">LOST MEDIA</span>] WebBrew p002</h4>

    <ul>

    <p>This version added a completely new IodineGBA gui. Its desktop app design inspired most custom WebBrew guis not only in the prototype era, but in the modern WebBrew/WasmNix era as well!</p>

    <h4>[<span style="color: green;">Available on GH</span>] WebBrew p004</h4>

    <p>Release Date: 12/13/2023</p>
    <p>The first release that still remains intact! This ones more of a demo than a release, tho.</p>
    <p>This demo showed of a prototype of the gui found in p005. It also showed some new apps that were being tested for the next release (including nesjs).</p>

    <p>Changelog</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Some test apps</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>[<span style="color: green;">Available on GH</span>] WebBrew p005</h4>

    <p>Release Date: 12/17/2023</p>
    <p>To clarify a few things first, this section talks about vanilla p005 WITHOUT the extended support packs or AubMas 2023!</p>
    <p>Finally, weve reached the version that actually matters. p005 is the first major WebBrew update since p001. It added a decent amount of Eaglercraft clients (originally provided by the Eaglercraft-Archive GH organization). It also added NesJS, a lightweight NES emulator that works even on the sh*tiest devices ive run WebBrew on.</p>
    <p>Also, we got a finished version of the new GUI!</p>

    <p>Changelog</p>
    <ul>
        <li>New launcher gui</li>
        <li>Added icons</li>
        <li>Apps now pop out as their own windows</li>
        <li>Added NesJS (with custom UI based on my IodineGBA gui)</li>
        <li>Added Resent Client (3.8)</li>
        <li>Added Shadow Client (3.0?)</li>
        <li>Eaglercraft Reborn [Eaglerforge Precursor] (Beta 1.1)</li>
        <li>Eaglercraft Beta (22w22b)</li>
    </ul>
